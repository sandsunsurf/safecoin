## Safecoin v2.0.0
==============

This is the official Safecoin sourcecode repository based on https://github.com/fair-exchange/safecoin.

## List of Safecoin Platform Technologies

- Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) - Additional security layer and Safecoins own consensus algorithm.
- zk-SNARKs - Safecoin Platform's privacy technology for shielded transactions
- Tokens/Assets Technology - create "colored coins" on the Safecoin Platform and use them as a layer for securites
- Reward API - Safecoin CC technology for securities
- CC - Crypto Conditions to realize "smart contract" logic on top of the Safecoin Platform
- Jumblr - Decentralized tumbler for SAFE and other cryptocurrencies
- Assetchains - Create your own Blockchain that inherits all Safecoin Platform functionalities and blockchain interoperability
- Pegged Assets - Chains that maintain a peg to fiat currencies  (SafeCash in progress)
- Peerchains - Scalability solution where sibling chains form a network of blockchains

## Tech Specification
- Max Supply: 36.2 million SAFE.
- Block Time: 1M 2s
- Block Reward: See schedule
- Mining Algorithm: Equihash 144_5 (Zhash)

## About this Project
Safecoin is a fork of the Komodo and Zcash projects, although we have incorporated significant changes including TLS Encryption from Horizen and Equihash 144_5, in collaboration with BTCZ.  Safecoin was launched as a pure Proof of Work coin, and has never had any ICO or Sale of any kind.   We are an Open Source, Peer to Peer project and we support and contribute to likewise initiatives.
Same Zcash is based on Bitcoin's code, with difference Zcash intends to offer a far higher standard of privacy through a sophisticated zero-knowledge proving scheme that preserves confidentiality of transaction metadata. Technical details are available in our [Protocol Specification](https://github.com/zcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf).

## Getting started

### Dependencies

```shell
#The following packages are needed:
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl
```

Secure Setup
-----------------
https://github.com/fair-exchange/safecoin/blob/master/SECURE_SETUP.md

### Build Safecoin

This software is based on zcash and considered experimental and is continously undergoing heavy development.

The dev branch is considered the bleeding edge codebase while the master-branch is considered tested (unit tests, runtime tests, functionality). At no point of time do the Safecoin Platform developers take any responsbility for any damage out of the usage of this software. 
Safecoin builds for all operating systems out of the same codebase. Follow the OS specific instructions from below.

#### Linux
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fair-exchange/safecoin --branch master --single-branch
cd safecoin
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```

#### OSX
Ensure you have [brew](https://brew.sh) and the command line tools installed (comes automatically with XCode) and run:
```shell
brew update && brew install gcc@6
git clone https://github.com/fair-exchange/safecoin --branch master --single-branch
cd safecoin
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```

#### Windows
Use a debian cross-compilation setup with mingw for windows and run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fair-exchange/safecoin --branch master --single-branch
cd safecoin
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build-win.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```
**safecoin is experimental and a work-in-progress.** Use at your own risk.

To reset the Safecoin blockchain change into the *~/.safecoin* data directory and delete the corresponding files by running `rm -rf blocks chainstate debug.log safecoinstate db.log`

#### Create safecoin.conf

Create a safecoin.conf file:

```
mkdir ~/.safecoin
cd ~/.safecoin
touch safecoin.conf

#Add the following lines to the safecoin.conf file:
rpcuser=yourrpcusername
rpcpassword=yoursecurerpcpassword
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
txindex=1
addnode=dnsseedua.local.support
addnode=dnsseed.ipv6admin.com
addnode=dnsseed.fair.exchange
addnode=explorer.safecoin.org
addnode=45.63.13.60
addnode=185.20.184.51
addnode=176.107.179.32
addnode=node.safc.cc
```
### Create your own Blockchain based on Safecoin

Safecoin allows anyone to create a runtime fork which represents an independent Blockchain. Below are the detailed instructions:
Setup two independent servers with at least 1 server having a static IP and build safecoind on those servers.  

#### On server 1 (with static IP) run:
```shell
./safecoind -ac_name=name_of_your_chain -ac_supply=100000 -bind=ip_of_server_1 &
```

#### On server 2 run:
```shell
./safecoind -ac_name=name_of_your_chain -ac_supply=100000 -addnode=ip_of_server_1 -gen &
```

**Safecoin is based on Zcash which is unfinished and highly experimental.** Use at your own risk.

**NOTE TO EXCHANGES:**
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1605144.msg17732151#msg17732151
There is a small chance that an outbound transaction will give an error due to mismatched values in wallet calculations. There is a -exchange option that you can run safecoind with, but make sure to have the entire transaction history under the same -exchange mode. Otherwise you will get wallet conflicts.

**To change modes:**

a) backup all privkeys (launch safecoind with `-exportdir=<path>` and `dumpwallet`)
b) start a totally new sync including `wallet.dat`, launch with same `exportdir`
c) stop it before it gets too far and import all the privkeys from a) using `safecoin-cli importwallet filename`
d) resume sync till it gets to chaintip

For example:
```shell
./safecoind -exportdir=/tmp &
./safecoin-cli dumpwallet example
./safecoin-cli stop
mv ~/.safecoin ~/.safecoin.old && mkdir ~/.safecoin && cp ~/.safecoin.old/safecoin.conf ~/.safecoin.old/peers.dat ~/.safecoin
./safecoind -exchange -exportdir=/tmp &
./safecoin-cli importwallet /tmp/example
```
